# Machine learning for question answering in the context of websites

This repository holds the code for my master thesis about building a question answering system in order to answer questions related to the content of websites. There are some scripts that can be used to fine-tune neural network based language models to the task of answer generation and code for webcrawlers that can index the websites used for this work.
